# Frontendeval.com Medium Difficulty Multiform
 Requirements: 
 Your PM has asked you to create the most annoying signup form in the world: a form that has 4 fields but on a series of 4 different screens. Your name, email, date of birth, and password will be entered separately into the site:

The specs are as follows:

1.Back links appear on every screen other than the first one, going back to the step the user was just on

2.Input is required on every screen prior to proceeding to the next.

3.On the last screen, provide a submit button that calls a handleSubmit({ name: ..., email: ..., password: ... }) function passing in the values of all the fields

4.Show a success screen

# Some Hints
The tricky part of this problem is keeping track of the state. How do you track what screen you’re on and what’s been submitted so far?

If you’re not using a framework, how do you swap in the different form fields? Do you reuse the same form fields and update the label text/input types, or do you swap in entirely new templates?

How do you ensure a good user experience? When do you validate the input? How do you handle going back to a previous screen on the form?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
